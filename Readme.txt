/*
* Created by Johnny Edgett
* Interacts with a database to perform simple queries and other fun stuff
* Edit Date 10-12-2015
* 
* Run the program, input server information, run query, get results.
* Only tested with server: localhost, port:3306, user: root, pass: root, schema: employee
* This program is just a little java jdbc connector. There are still plenty of things wrong with it, and plenty of things that need to be changed/added. I just wanted to go ahead and throw it up out there. Input connection settings, run query. ResultSet will output data to console.
*
* Todo: 
* -Output ResultSet to frame
* -Catch more errors/Better exception handling
